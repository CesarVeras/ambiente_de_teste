						SEMINAR<br>
				Prof. Cédric Richard (France)
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>DATE:</b> March/09/2009 <br>
				<b>TIME:</b> 4 h PM <br>
				<b>TITLE:</b> Distributed learning in wireless sensor networks
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Abstract:</b><br>
				Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks have emerged as an interesting and important research area in the last few years. They rely on sensor devices deployed in an environment to support sensing and monitoring, including temperature, humidity, motion, acoustic, etc. Low cost and miniaturization of sensors involve limited computational resources, power and communication capacities. Consequently, wireless ad-hoc sensor networks require collaborative execution of a distributed task on a large set of sensors, with reduced communication and computation burden. In this presentation, we consider the problem of modelling physical phenomena, and track their evolution over time. We also focus our interest on auto-localization of sensor nodes. These questions are addressed with kernel-based methods, a class of model-independent approaches that have been intensively investigated in the statistical machine learning community over the last decade.

				<b>Brief biography:</b><br>
				Cédric Richard was born January 24, 1970 in Sarrebourg, France. I received the Dipl.-Ing. and the M.S. degrees in 1994 and the Ph.D. degree in 1998 from the University of Technology of Compiègne, France, all in electrical and computer engineering. From 1999 to 2003, he was an Associate Professor at the University of Technology of Troyes, France. Since 2003, he is a Full Professor in the Institut Charles Delaunay (ICD, CNRS FRE 2848), LM2S Group, at UTT. He is also the current supervisor of the LM2S Group, which consists of 60 researchers and Ph.D. students. His current research interests include statistical signal processing and machine learning. Prof. Cédric Richard is the author of over 90 papers. He was the General Chair of the XXIth francophone conference GRETSI on Signal and Image Processing that was held in Troyes, France, in 2007. Since 2005, he is in charge of the Ph.D. students network of the federative CNRS research group ISIS on Information, Signal, Images and Vision. He is a member of GRETSI association board and of the EURASIP society, and Senior Member of the IEEE. Since 2006, Cédric Richard serves as an associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing and of the Research Letters in Signal Processing. Recently, he was nominated Eurasip liaison local officer for France, and member of the Signal Processing Theory and Methods (SPTM) Technical Committee of the IEEE Signal Processing Society.
